To run the app run:
```
./bootstrap.sh
```

To validate if app is running check localhost:30007 or 127.0.0.1:3007

To validate that ConfigMap and Secrets are mounted as a file:
```
kubectl get pods -n todoapp -o wide

kubectl exec -it {name_of_app_pod} -- sh

# inside the pod
ls
```
If it gives the secrets and configs directories there are they
```
cd {secrets / configs}

cat {file_that_value_you_need}
```
